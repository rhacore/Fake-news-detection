# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based fake news detection system that classifies news articles as **real** or **fake**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to clean and vectorize news text, and applies classification algorithms to detect misinformation.
